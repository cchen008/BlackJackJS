# BlackJackJS

BlackJackJS is a website that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website allows the user to play a game of Black Jack against the dealer.

## Motivation
BlackJackJS is a project that was started after I graduated to help me learn and practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As I increase my knowledge
on front end developmentt and learn better coding practices, I hope to add more features and fix any problems with my code.
