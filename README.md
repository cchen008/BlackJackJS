# BlackJackJS

BlackJackJS is a website that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website allows the user to play a game of Black Jack against the dealer.

## Motivation
BlackJackJS is a project that was started after I graduated to help me learn and practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I hope to add more features and fix any problems with my code
as I increase my knowledge on front end development and learn better coding practices.

## Website
Test out the website by going to https://cchen008.github.io/BlackJackJS/bj.html
